                <p id='bio-text'>I am currently an MS Candidate in
                    Computational Analysis and Public Policy at the
                    Harris school of Public Policy at the University of
                    Chicago. I am currently completing my degree
                    remotely while studying in Pittsburgh, and am
                    looking for jobs in data.

                <p id='bio-text'>While I am searcing for roles in the 
                    public, private, and non-profit sector, I am 
                    particularly interested in areas in and around 
                    progressive-leaning policy and politics. My policy 
                    interests revolve around voting rights and election 
                    systems, and I have experience working in technical 
                    roles with political partners.
